# Snakes or Ladders? A Time-Series Network Analysis of Premodern Korean Civil Examination Data


Using concepts from the fields of social physics and complexity science, this interdisciplinary study introduces a time-series network analysis that tracks macrohistorical changes in kinship data from the Chosŏn dynasty 朝鮮 (1392-1910). Our approach is able to measure changing degrees of intergenerational social mobility, both upward and downward, across multiple time scales using a model of centrality values. Our test case explores the approximately 14,600 higher civil examination degree holders in the Academy of Korean Studies edition of the Munkwa database (Munkwa pangmok 文科榜目), in particular the previously underutilized records about the agnatic and affinal relations of each candidates, up to three generations above him.
